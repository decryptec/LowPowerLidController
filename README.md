# LowPowerLidController
A low-power, autonomous trashcan lid controller. Prototyped with an Arduino Uno Rev 3, then optimized using an ATtiny84, custom PCB, and lithium-ion battery for long-term operation. Includes code for both phases, showcasing the full development lifecycle from rapid prototyping to energy-efficient design.
